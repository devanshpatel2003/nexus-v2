# Nvidia Export Controls Case Study — Overview
doc_id: case_overview

## Context
Since August 2022, the US Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) has implemented increasingly restrictive export controls on advanced AI semiconductors destined for China. These controls represent the most significant technology export restrictions since the Cold War.

## Central Question
How do geopolitical export controls affect semiconductor company valuations, competitive dynamics, and the broader AI ecosystem?

## Key Themes

### 1. Creative Destruction
Export controls are a form of government-imposed creative destruction. By restricting Nvidia's access to the Chinese market, they create opportunities for competitors (AMD, Intel) and accelerate development of domestic Chinese alternatives (Huawei Ascend).

### 2. Revenue Impact vs. Market Reaction
Despite significant revenue at risk ($400M in Q3 2022 alone), Nvidia's stock recovered and reached all-time highs driven by AI demand. Market reaction to restrictions was consistently smaller than the positive impact of AI demand growth.

### 3. Supply Chain Cascading Effects
Controls don't just affect chip designers. They cascade through:
- Foundries (TSMC cannot manufacture restricted chips for Chinese customers)
- Equipment makers (ASML cannot sell EUV to China)
- Cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP face deployment restrictions)

### 4. Regulatory Cat-and-Mouse
Nvidia designed workaround chips (A800/H800) that were subsequently restricted. This demonstrates an iterative regulatory tightening cycle that creates persistent uncertainty.

### 5. Statistical Reality
In our CAR analysis, only 1 of 11 events was statistically significant. This is an honest finding that reflects the reality of event studies: individual regulatory events are often absorbed quickly by markets, especially when broader demand trends (AI buildout) dominate.
