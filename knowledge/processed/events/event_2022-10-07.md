# Sweeping China Chip Controls (October 7 Rules)
doc_id: event_2022-10-07
date: 2022-10-07
severity: Critical
event_type: New Restriction
tickers: NVDA, AMD, INTC, TSM, ASML
source: BIS Federal Register, Commerce Department

## Summary
BIS announces the most comprehensive export controls on advanced semiconductors to China since the Cold War. Controls cover chips, manufacturing equipment, and US persons working in China fabs. This was a regime shift in US-China tech decoupling.

## Chips Affected
A100, H100, A800, H800, Advanced GPUs, manufacturing equipment

## Countries Targeted
China

## Market Impact
- NVDA 5-day reaction: -12.4%
- AMD 5-day reaction: -8.1%
- Broad semiconductor selloff

## Key Provisions
1. Performance thresholds for compute chips (TOPS-based restrictions)
2. Equipment restrictions (ASML EUV, deposition, etch tools)
3. US person restrictions (Americans cannot support China fabs)
4. Entity list expansions

## Significance
The October 7 Rules marked the most sweeping technology export controls since the Cold War. They fundamentally changed the competitive landscape by restricting not just chips but the entire supply chain including equipment (ASML) and foundry services (TSMC). This single event reshaped semiconductor investment theses globally.
