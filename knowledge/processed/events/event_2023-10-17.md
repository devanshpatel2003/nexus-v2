severity: High

## Summary
BIS closes the A800/H800 loophole by restricting China-specific chip variants. Also adds restrictions on chip-making equipment and additional entities. Consumer GPUs (RTX 4090) also restricted.

## Chips Affected
A800, H800, L40S, RTX 4090

## Market Impact
- NVDA 5-day reaction: -4.7%
- AMD 5-day reaction: -2.1%

## Significance
Nvidia had designed the A800/H800 specifically to comply with October 7 performance thresholds while still serving the China market. BIS closing this loophole demonstrated that the US government would continue tightening controls to prevent workarounds, creating persistent regulatory uncertainty for chip designers.
