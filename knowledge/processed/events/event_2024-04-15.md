## Summary
Reports emerge that Huawei's domestically-produced Ascend 910B approaches H100 performance for some AI training workloads. This raised fundamental questions about the long-term effectiveness of export controls.

## Market Impact
- NVDA 5-day reaction: -3.1%
- AMD 5-day reaction: +0.5%

## Significance
The Ascend 910B represents the first credible domestic Chinese alternative to restricted US AI chips. While still behind on software ecosystem (CUDA vs. MindSpore) and multi-chip scaling, its existence challenges the premise that export controls can permanently deny China access to competitive AI hardware. This creates a long-term competitive concern for Nvidia: controls may accelerate Chinese self-sufficiency rather than prevent it.
