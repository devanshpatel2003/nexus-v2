## Summary
Commerce Department proposes the most aggressive licensing policy yet: presumption of denial for advanced AI chip exports to China. This would effectively ban most exports of AI accelerators.

## Chips Affected
H100, H200, B100, and all advanced AI accelerators

## Market Impact
- NVDA 5-day reaction: -9.5%
- AMD 5-day reaction: -6.2%

## Significance
The presumption of denial proposal represented a potential shift from case-by-case licensing to a near-blanket ban. Industry lobbying intensified in response. The market reaction was the second-largest after October 7, reflecting the severity of the proposed policy change.
