# Biden Administration Finalizes AI Diffusion Rule
doc_id: event_2025-01-15
date: 2025-01-15
severity: High
event_type: New Restriction
tickers: NVDA, AMD, INTC, TSM, ASML
source: Commerce Department Final Rule

## Summary
Outgoing Biden administration finalizes a framework for AI chip exports creating a tiered country system. Close allies get preferential access while China remains restricted.

## Key Provisions
1. Tier 1: Close allies (Japan, Netherlands, etc.) — minimal restrictions
2. Tier 2: Most countries — caps on total compute deployed
3. Tier 3: China, Russia, etc. — presumption of denial

## Chips Affected
H200, B100, B200, all advanced AI chips

## Market Impact
- NVDA 5-day reaction: -5.2%
- AMD 5-day reaction: -3.8%

## Significance
The AI Diffusion Rule institutionalized the tiered approach to chip export controls. It affected not just China but created a global framework impacting TSMC (foundry for restricted chips), ASML (equipment restrictions enforced via Dutch government cooperation), and hyperscalers (data center deployment caps in Tier 2 countries).
