# Controls Extended to AI Model Weights
doc_id: event_2025-10-12
date: 2025-10-12
severity: High
event_type: Control Expansion
tickers: NVDA, AMD, GOOGL, MSFT, AMZN
source: BIS Proposed Rule

## Summary
BIS proposes extending export controls beyond hardware to AI model weights and training techniques. This represents a significant expansion of regulatory scope from silicon to software.

## Market Impact
- NVDA 5-day reaction: -2.1%
- AMD 5-day reaction: -1.5%

## Significance
This was the first extension of export controls beyond hardware into the software domain. It directly affects hyperscalers (Google, Microsoft, Amazon) who deploy large AI models globally. The proposal raises questions about how model weight restrictions can be enforced technically and whether open-source models would be exempt.
