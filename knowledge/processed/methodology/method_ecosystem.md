# Semiconductor Ecosystem Mapping
doc_id: method_ecosystem

## Why Expand Beyond NVDA/AMD/INTC
Export controls affect the entire semiconductor value chain, not just GPU designers. Understanding the full ecosystem reveals supply chain spillovers and competitive dynamics.

## Ecosystem Groups

### GPU Leaders (directly targeted)
- **NVDA (Nvidia)**: Primary target. A100/H100/H200/B100 restricted. ~$10B+ annual China revenue at risk.
- **AMD**: Secondary target. MI series GPUs restricted alongside Nvidia. Smaller China exposure.

### Legacy Semiconductor
- **INTC (Intel)**: Gaudi AI accelerators + foundry services. Moderate China exposure. Pivoting to foundry model.

### Foundry & Equipment (supply chain)
- **TSM (TSMC)**: Manufactures most restricted chips. Caught in entity list restrictions. Cannot serve certain Chinese customers.
- **ASML**: Sole supplier of EUV lithography. Dutch government cooperated with US restrictions on EUV exports to China.

### Networking & Custom Silicon
- **AVGO (Broadcom)**: Networking chips, custom ASIC design. Limited direct China AI exposure but affected by broader supply chain shifts.

### Hyperscalers (building alternatives)
- **GOOGL (Google/Alphabet)**: TPU (Tensor Processing Unit) — internal AI chip. Not exported, but Cloud AI services affected in restricted regions.
- **AMZN (Amazon)**: Trainium/Inferentia — custom AI chips for AWS. Internal use reduces direct export risk, but AWS China operations affected.
- **MSFT (Microsoft)**: Maia/Cobalt — custom AI chips. Azure AI services in restricted regions impacted.

## Investment Implications
1. Export controls create both losers (NVDA China revenue) and potential winners (AMD, custom silicon alternatives)
2. Equipment makers (ASML) are collateral damage — Dutch/Japanese cooperation means non-US companies are also restricted
3. Hyperscaler custom chips may accelerate as alternative to restricted NVDA GPUs
4. TSMC's foundry model means it's caught between US and China regardless of its own policy preferences
